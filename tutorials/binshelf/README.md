# Multigrid bin with angled shelf connector

This tutorial describes how to install a simple bin shelf and bin using Multigrid bins

## Parts list

* [1x1 bin] ( https://than.gs/m/973813 ) A bin
* [T-connector] ( https://than.gs/m/973872 ) A t connector to fasten the shelf to the tile
* [1x1 bin shelf] ( https://than.gs/m/974143 ) The shelf itself

## Steps
1. Print all the components
2. Attach the bin to a multiboard tile using the T connector
3. Insert the bin into the shelf

## Notes
* The bin print is a little tricky - overhangs may be an issue
* The bin will snap comfortably into the shelf to prevent it from falling off easily.
